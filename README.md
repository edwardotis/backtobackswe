# Back To Back SWE

An initiative to empower the software engineer to excel in the interview.

<b>Website:</b> https://backtobackswe.com <br>

<b>Some Topics A Software Engineer Probably Needs To Know To Pass A Big N Interview:</b>

- Fundamentals of Computer Systems (just a general knowing how computers store information etc.)
- Big O Time & Space Complexity Computation
- Arrays
- Primitives
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashtables
- Linked Lists
- Sorting
- Searching
- Min/Max Heaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees, Binary Trees, & Binary Search Trees
- System and OO design Principles (sometimes)

And that is pretty much it for Data Structures & Algorithms.

The channel's goal is to contribute to the community of people bridging
these topics to help engineers excel in the interview.

It has nothing to do with me. I am just here to communicate the ideas.

I am only a humble teacher, I am not perfect.

If even one person gets an offer from my work my day is complete.

## Contributing

I'd love any contributions from people to this repo. I just restructured it so that solutions in multiple languages can be added for a single problem.

Just make sure that you follow the style conventions of your respective language.

## Mistakes

I'm not perfect. I watch finished videos 2 times over. I read and test all code samples. But I still make errors.

If you see a mistake anywhere just open a pr & I'll merge it in.

## Best Books For Prep

My Comments: Cracking The Coding Interview is a good start but pales in comparison to how much Elements
of Programming Interviews (EPI) will prepare you for the interview. Everything that I do has been inspired
by this book. To date, I have read it nearly 5 times and skimmed it 4 times.
